# Perron-Frobenius Python Scripts
Python code to supplement my essay titled "The Perron-Frobenius Theorem and Ranking Methods".

motivation1.py is used to generate the graph and matrix in the essay, and motivation2.py is essentially the same, but without the simplifications used in the essay for typographical reasons.

rankings.py requires the results.csv file in the same folder as it is ran, and is used to rank the teams for last season, and predict the final positions of this season. It is relatively easy to run the program on other data.
